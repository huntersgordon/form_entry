# form_entry
This collection of codes fills out online contest forms.

  written in:
    C++,
    PHP
  utilizes code written in:
    PYTHON,
    PERL
 
How it works:
  uses a command line program called "googler" (creds to jarun)
    queries the string "for a chance to win"
      gets results from past day
  takes links, then CURLs them, getting the code
    uses formfind.pl (creds to Daniel Stenberg,2002)
      then fills out the form based on keywords.
 
 Ultimate Goal:
   to win contests/giveaways. 
     if many contests are entered, then liklihood of winning is greater!
